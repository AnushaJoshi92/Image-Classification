# Image-Classification
Image classification using 25000 images using tensorflow

1. Images are labelled as: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street
2. Data visualization
3. Added callback function to stop the model run once 80% accuracy is reached
4. Added convolutional neural network layers to train all the images
5. Rescale the intensity values of the images
6. Fit the data and calculate accuacy
